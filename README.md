# cudaRC
runs the code from cuda remotely via dynamic linker library(dll).  

# Library in need:
this project relies on my another project, [CPure](https://github.com/yuisanae2f/CPure)

# method
run [cudaTheatre.exe](https://github.com/yuisanae2f/cudaRC/tree/Theatre), to serve data and run the code.
